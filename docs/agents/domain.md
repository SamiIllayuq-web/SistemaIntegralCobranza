# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`docs/domain/glossary.md`** — domain vocabulary (clientes, carteras, entidades financieras, importación, exportación, reportes).
- **`docs/domain/README.md`** — entry point / overview.
- **`docs/adr/`** — Architectural Decision Records. Read any ADR that touches the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence.

## File structure

```
/
├── docs/
│   ├── domain/
│   │   ├── README.md      ← entry point
│   │   └── glossary.md    ← vocabulary
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-...md
│       └── 0002-...md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `docs/domain/glossary.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
